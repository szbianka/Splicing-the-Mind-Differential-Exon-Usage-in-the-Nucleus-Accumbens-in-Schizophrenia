## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository accompanies the Master’s thesis **“Splicing the Mind: Differential Exon Usage in the Nucleus Accumbens in Schizophrenia.”**  
The project bridges cognitive science and molecular psychiatry through the analysis of transcriptomic data.  

The study investigates whether **schizophrenia is associated with differential exon usage (DEU)** in the **nucleus accumbens (NAcc)** — a subcortical brain region central to motivation and reward processing — and evaluates the potential of **curated multi-study resources**, such as **QIAGEN’s OmicSoft DiseaseLand**, to support reproducible splicing analyses.

Using the **DEXSeq** framework in R, the analysis tests for exon-level regulation differences between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls across two publicly available RNA-seq studies.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Python environment
Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements_python.txt
```
### R environment
```bash
pkgs <- readLines("requirements_R.txt")
install.packages(sub("==.*", "", pkgs))
```
## Execution Notes:
- The combined DEU analysis (two-study model) is computationally intensive and may take ~30 hours on a local machine.
Consider using a high-performance or cloud-based environment (e.g., virtual machine or a server with ≥32 GB RAM) for faster execution.

## Data resource
- 🧬 QIAGEN OmicSoft DiseaseLand (licensed)

## 🧠 Research Significance

This project illustrates how cognitive scientists can approach biomedical data analysis with a focus on reproducibility and interpretability.
It emphasizes:
- the importance of open and standardized data curation in psychiatric research,
- the potential of transcriptomic biomarkers to bridge molecular and behavioral levels of explanation, and
- the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between data science, psychiatry, and cognitive neuroscience.
