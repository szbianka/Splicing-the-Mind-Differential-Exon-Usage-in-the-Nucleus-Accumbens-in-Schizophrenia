Master's Thesis in Cognitive Science. A cognitive scientist's approach to biomedical data analysis and interpretation.

This GitHub repository contains:
- a tutorial notebook for DEXSeq analysis using QIAGEN's OmicSoft resource (NB: requires a license)
- a requirements text file with the necessary libraries

NB: the analysis (combined) takes quite a while when ran locally (around 30 hours), so use a strong virtual machine if faster computations are desired!
